          <h2>WHY DONATING BLOOD?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Donating blood saves lives by providing essential support for
          surgeries, emergencies, cancer treatments, and chronic illnesses.
          Each donation can help up to three people, as blood components like
          red cells, plasma, and platelets are used in various medical
          situations. Itâ€™s a simple way to give back and make a significant
          impact on community health.

        <h2>TYPE OF DONATION</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The human body typically contains around five liters of blood, a complex mixture of cellular and non-cellular
        elements like red <b>blood cells</b>, <b>platelets</b>, and <b>platelets</b>.

      </p>
      <p>
        Each component has distinct properties, making it valuable for various medical needs. At blood centers, donated
        blood is carefully divided into these components, allowing a single donation to potentially impact up to four
        lives, depending on the number of separate components that can be derived from it.

          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p>
            Blood collected directly from a donor into a blood bag containing an anticoagulant is known as whole blood.
            This whole blood is then processed through centrifugation to separate it into red cells, platelets, and
            plasma. The separated red cells are then preserved with a special solution, transforming them into what is
            known as packed red blood cells.
